## Trading Strategies


#### Basic Strategy
This is one of the simplestst strategy. Being the easiest to implement, this will lead to bad trading decisions most of the time. Let us consider a situation where a stock's price increases for n-1 days and then suddenly drops on the nth day, for example increases for a few days by huge amounts before dropping by 1 rupee. This might turnout to be very frequent leading to no buy signals. Similar goes for the converse case.


#### DMA 
We can combine different moving averages to get better sense of the trends. For example, we can have a fast moving average (window = 50 days) and a slow moving average (window = 200 days). Now, we can identify significant turning points in the market, such as a death cross. A death cross occurs when the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average. <br>

This is considered as a good time to sell shares. Another similar turning point is a golden cross, which has the opposite trend with respect to a death cross.

#### DMA++
The DMA++ or AMA (Adaptive Moving Average) is one of the best indicators for analyzing market trends.
